This is weather app.

Main goal is to take data from https://open-meteo.com/ and shows then according to assignment.

For running just write to cmd: npm run start

I had lot of ideas what to add but not much time, that is why i focused mainly on functionality and at the end on styling. Thats why implemented clean and easy style. You can easily track my progress on github commit by commit.
